data toggles for ehci

DATA0=0, DATA1=1

the data toggle can really mess up your usb transactions if not done correctly
run() will give a time out error

Here are some rules as I see them:

1) each endpoint maintains its own toggle which alternates between 0 and 1 with each TD

2) on port reset host and device set there toggles to 0

3) control transfers (getting device, config, endpint descriptors ...)
	* command transport: PID=OUT and toggle=0
	* data transport   : PID=IN  and toggle=1
	* status transport : PID=OUT and toggle=1
   if there is no data transport (like SetAddress, SetConfiguration) then
    * status transport : PID=IN  and toggle=1

	we have a seperate queue head for control transfers that is setup 
	so the controller takes the toggle from the qTD, see initehci.s

4) for EHCI bulk transfers which begin with "Inquiry" et all, 
   we still use toggle values set manually in software and the QH is setup to use
   the toggle from the qTD. When we get to Read10 and Write10 we are using 
   dword [bulktogglein] and dword [bulktoggleout] to manage the toggles

;initflash


;code to prepare a usb flash drive for read/write
;get the flash drive usb descriptors
;do SetAddress, SetConfiguration etc...

;suitable for use with:
;0) usb 1.0: the old uhci with only 2 usb root ports on back of my desktop
;1) usb 2.0: ehci having uhci companion controllers (Via pci addon card)
;2) usb 2.0: ehci with root hub  (my Acer laptop running windows 7)

;see tatOS.config which requires you to set the USBCONTROLLERTYPE
;and then reassemble

;prior to calling this function the ehci usb controller must be setup
;including populating the ehci async list

;if any transfer descriptor TD fails we jump back to reset the port and try again
;usually there is success the first time thru but sometimes we have to reset the port
;a second time. If a flash drive endpoint halts, then you must reinit the usb controller
;and try init flash again. It usually always passes the 2nd time.

;we store the various usbmass descriptors
;(device,condiguration,interface,endpoint)
;starting at 0x5000
;see /doc/memorymap for details

;GetMaxLun
;we dont support this command
;we assume the device (pendrive) does not support multiple luns
;the usbmass spec states a device that does not 
;support multiple luns may stall this command
;all our SCSI CBW use bCBWLUN=0

;Bulk Only Mass Storage Reset is also unsupported
;I experimented with this a couple years ago and it didnt have the desired affect
;if you have a failed read10/write10 just reinit the controller and flash

;the ehci driver now uses all 5 page pointers for maximum data transfer rates
;and this has also increased reliability greatly. 

;this code will only handle one hi speed device plugged into a port
;if there is more than 1 hi speed device plugged in there will be problems

	;as of Dec 2015 we have not had any failed usb flash drive transactions

	;refresh the QH without reinitting the controller but for now its not

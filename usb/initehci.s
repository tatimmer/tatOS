;code to setup the ehci usb controller for flash drive transactions under tatos

;the ehci is a high speed usb controller for flash drive
;but it can not handle the low speed mouse directly
;the hardware vendors handle the low speed mouse two ways:
;  1) ehci + companion controllers (usually uhci)
;  2) ehci + root hub
;the companion controllers or the root hub will service the low speed mouse


;we note here a few differances between EHCI and UHCI
;UHCI has a single frame list for all transaction types 
;EHCI has two differant lists:
;	* asynchronous circular link list for control/bulk transactions
;	* frame list for interrupt transactions
;Queue Heads
;	* UHCI are a simple pair of dwords 
;	* EHCI are a 68 byte structure
;	* EHCI queue heads contain device/endpoint specific data
;Transfer descriptors for both uhci and ehci are 32 bytes 
;but the bitfields are organized differantly
;ehci is memory mapped, uhci uses port i/o 

;Purpose:
;functions to init the usb EHCI controller
;Get the base address needed for usb transactions. 
;Also resets the usb controller and sets up the frame list and 
;queue heads for usbmass/bulk and usbmouse/interrupt transactions

;Problems:
;if you have problems with this code try the following:
;* disconnect all attached usb devices especially low speed (mouse)
;* after bootup remove the boot flash drive before ehci controller init
;* use usb ports on the back of your desktop not the front
;  ports on the front are connected to the controller thru a "hub" which is unsupported
;* some ports may be hardwired to ohci controllers which are unsupported so try others
;* consult your datasheet, some devices have specific pci config registers
;* use hardware that provides datasheets like Intel,AMD,Via, not nVidia

;the bus:dev:fun pci config address (dword) of the usb controllers is stored at:
;0x5d8, UHCI companion #1  (UHCIBUSDEVFUNCOM1)
;0x5dc, UHCI companion #2  (UHCIBUSDEVFUNCOM2)
;EHCIBUSDEVFUN, EHCI controller
;UHCIBUSDEVFUN, UHCI primary controller

	;PERIODIC Frame List 
	;*********************

	;generate one QH to conduct mouse interrupt tranfers using this frame list

	;Smask = 01
	;a non-zero Smask value is required for interrupt transfers
	;Smask=01 means 00000001b or the mouse interrupt occurs at the 
	;beginning of the frame (each frame is divided into 8 pieces) 
	;each of the 8 bits in Smask represents 1/8th or a microframe of time
	;and completion of the interrupt wont cross a frame boundary with a value of 1 
	;see section 4.12.2 and figure 4-17 of USB 2.0 spec
	;this also means you dont have to deal with FSTN's (Frame Span Traversal Node)

	;Cmask = 0x1c
	;page 94 of the usb 2.0 spec suggests this value for case=1 of fig 4-17
	;dont know any more, it works
	;frankly I think the ehci authors should have hid Smask & Cmask all in the hardware
	;uhci was alot easier to deal with
	;the so called "universal" series bus could hide more functionality in the hdwre
	;and be a little less universal 

	;we use a frame list of 1024 pointers 
	;if you write a valid QH address to the first entry in the list 
	;and mark all the others as invalid 01 
	;then the mouse response is very slow

tedit is the text editor included with tatOS. 
It is assembled into tlib as executable code.

tedit uses a double link list starting at 0x100000
1meg is reserved allowing for 750,000 max chars per file

CUT/COPY/PASTE is same as windows CTRL+X, CTRL+C, CTRL+V
selection is made with SHIFT down and moving arrow keys
Ctrl+y yanks/copies a single word at the caret to CLIPBOARD 

scrolling is done with the arrow keys, PAGEUP, PAGEDN, HOME, END
thru the manipulation of the "toplink"
toplink is the address of the first char drawn at upper left

Ctrl+f to enter a string to find/search 
Ctrl+n to find the next instance
Ctrl+8 jumps to the next instance of word at caret, then Ctrl+n

Goto is handled with Ctrl+g to jump to a line number

there are several options to delete characters:
Delete 1 character at the caret
Ctrl+Delete delete 1 word
Alt+Delete  delete a large block of chars from starting charnum (prompt) to caret
Shift+Arrows then Delete the selection

by default tedit file->open appends data to the existing link list at the caret
unless you press F7 to clear first. 
if your usb File->save fails you can reinit the controller and flash
and return to your tedit memory block and repeat the save

each tedit link is 12 bytes:
  byte char     (this is the ascii keypress)
  byte select   (1=selected, 0=not selected)
  word unused   (added to keep dword alignment
  dword prev    (address of prev char link)
  dword next    (address of next char link)

if ebp holds address of a link then:
 byte  [ebp]   = the ascii char
 byte  [ebp+1] = selected or not
 dword [ebp+4] = address of previous link
 dword [ebp+8] = address of next link

messagepointer
to display a 0 terminated string along the bottom of the screen
do mov dword [messagepointer],AddressofMyString
on the next paint cycle your message will show up

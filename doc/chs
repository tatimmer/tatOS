IBM P/C CHS CYlinder Head Sector Addressing notes

This info is useful for designing bootloaders which need the IBM p/c compatible
bios to load sectors from disc. This bios uses cylinder-head-sector addressing.


                    Sector        Head           Cylinder
                    **********    *************  **********

encoding qty bits   6             8              10

address start       1             0              0

address end         0x3f=63       0xfe=254 [1]   0x3ff=1023

max qty             63            255            1024


[1] BIOS compatible with early MSDOS will only allow head address
up to 0xfe

512 byte/sector * 63 sector/track * 255 heads * 1024 cylinders
= 8 gig limit

EIDE, ATA-2, ECHS schemes have extended the limit 
see extended int 13h functions

DOS & old Windows partitions must start/end on a cylinder boundry

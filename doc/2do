tatOS 2do - Dec 2015

A list of things I want to add to tatOS. Not in any order, as the spirit moves me.


USB DRIVER::
	- rewrite usb driver code to handle failed TD's on flash drive init
		* without having to reinit controller
		* quicker
		* without having to reboot sometimes
	- why does the mouse occasionally freeze ? (usbcheckmouse fail to queue up ???)
	- driver for usb keyboard
	- driver for usb 3.0 xHCI (someday when we get hdwre)


FAT filesystem & Filemanager:
	- support for partitions 
	- the '.' and '..' entries should have ENTER key capability
	- support for subdirectories within subdirectories


APPS:
	- tcadd: split into multiple source files, 
	   add circle, arc, text, dimension, dxf/step
	- asteroids, puzzle, solitaire, tatsnow, pong
	- draw gear tooth involute profile, 2d glxgears in rotation
	- 3d flat shading demo
	- Littlebits: 
		*ability to edit large BTS images whos grid will not fit on the screen
		*set current color from the image grid
		*move a collection of pixels in the grid
	- a paint program :line/circle/arc...


TLIB:
	- function filltriangle or fillpolygon
	- function thickline
	- function to mesh a polygon area with triangles
	- function to draw a graph of data points with legend, labels...
	- function to scale up bitmaps 
	- function to draw a table with text or bitmap in the cells
	- function arc3p (finish what you started)
	- expand calc for fpu capability
	- medium cut algorithm for determining optimum color palette from 24bit DIB image
	- display "power of two" as a font character using byte sequence 0xc2 0xb2 like vim
	- add a scaleable and filled font like TimesNewRoman
	- simple html viewer
	- get rid of all indirect tlib.s function calls except what /boot needs
	- rewrite xxd to display up to 250 blocks 
	- rewrite xxd to display the exact file size (no trailing zeros on last line)
	- support for UTF-8 
	- support for higher graphics resolution: 16 bpp or 24bpp or 32bpp
	- add find/search to viewtxt to quickly jump to addresses in the assembled code
	- all the graphic controls need to save YORIENT, set YORIENT=1 then restore on exit
	- palette manager ability to display rgb component of any color box
	- palette manager ability to set stock background color 38,34,27
	- function dumpst0 which includes a string tag like dumpeax


TEDIT:
	- multiple document interface
	- replace text
	- correct a problem in CaretNextLink for lines > 80char
	- ability to read off pen drive as ascii hex bytes, edit and save back
	- ability to move the carot vertically at current position not at the end of line
	- hyperlink/bookmark to quickly jump to spots in the source code


TTASM: 
	- fix dq error
	- assemble multiple source files into object files then into 1 big exe
	- assemble itself, then assemble tatOS (self hosting)
	- expand memory addressing [reg1 + reg2] 
	- eliminate the need to set all memory addresses to 0 on the 1st pass
	- equ should print error message if dword numerical value is missing
	- need "and dword [memory],1
	- need BT or TEST for bit testing


BOOT:
	- implement UEFI boot (dont have any hardware for this yet)
	- make the code to load tatOS more flexible as tlib grows

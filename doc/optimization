Optimization
May 2009

Every assembly language programmer should learn as much as possible
about this topic. 

Download and study the Intel Pentium "Optimization" manuals. 
There are pdf's freely available on the web.
These manuals also give the instruction timings.

See also Agner Fogs "Optimizing Subroutines in Assembly Language".

Topics for further study:

branch prediction and elimination
partial register or read/write stalls
data alignment, location
avoiding and unrolling loops
instruction pairing 
counting clocks, latency & throughput, measuring performance
problematic instructions
out of order execution
dependency chains
code size vs speed

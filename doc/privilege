The CPL or current priviledge level is determined by bits 0,1 of the
segment selector currently in CS
To tell the processor we are running at a differant privilege level
we just load a new segment selector from the gdt 
and or bits1:0 to either 0 for kernel or 3 for user
mov ebx,cs will put the current code segment into ebx
for tatOS 0x08 is kernel code selector with DPL=0 
0x1b will be user code with DPL=3

The IOPL or i/o privilege level is usually always 0 in tatOS.
this can be verified by examining bits 12,13 of eflags
IOPL of 3 does not give access to the in/out port instructions.

disasm

ndisasm is a utility that comes with nasm. It only works on flat binary files.

Disassembling the binary files is useful when you have an error 
and want to know where the program stopped. The bochslog will give you among other 
things the value of EIP when the program quit.


to disassemble boot1.s:
ndisasm -b 16 -o 0x7c00 boot1 > out


to disassemble boot2.s:
this only applies to the 16 bit code at the beginning
ndisasm -b 16 -o 0x600 boot2 > out


to disassemble application.s:
ndisasm -b 32 -o 0x1200 application > out


to disassemble a DOS .com file:
ndisasm -b 16 -o 0x100 mycomfile.com > out

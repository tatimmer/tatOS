What is an image file ?
**************************
An image file is executable code with direct hardware access.
An image file may have an extension of img. 
The file is usually associated with small hobby operating systems.  
The image file contains the operating system, kernel and drivers 
and applications all in one file. 

The image file interacts with your computer hardware directly. 
This means that your computer hardware must match exactly the 
capabilities of the image file.  Also you can not run the image 
file from Linux or Windows except with an emulator like Bochs or Qemu
or VmWare. Instead you must copy the image file to a disc and boot the disc.



How do I make an image file ?
*********************************
To build one of my image file projects on Linux, just cd to the 
top level directory where the makefile is located and type "make". 
You must have the GNU "make" utility and NASM assembler installed.
Or you can just build the image file in steps according to what 
the makefile tells you.  Using NASM:

	nasm -f bin boot/boot1.s
    nasm -f bin boot/boot2.s
	nasm -f bin tlib/tlib.s 
	nasm -f bin build.s -o tatos.img



How do I get the image file onto a floppy disc ?
*************************************************
On Linux use the program "dd" to copy the image file to disc. 
Do not mount the disc first. Insert a blank floppy into the fd0 
drive then issue this command: 

	dd if=myimagefile.img of=/dev/fd0

Note that the filesystem on the disc is destroyed. You will not 
be able to mount or view any files on the disc (no matter).

Or you can also use "cp":

	cp myimagefile.img /dev/fd0

On Windows you can use the program "RawWrite" to write the image 
file to floppy.

If you have an external floppy with usb attach the command may be this:
	dd if=myimagefile.img of=/dev/sda

On Linux the usb ports are sda, sdb, sdc... Use the "dmesg" command to find
out what the Linux dev number is. Just plug the device in then issue "dmesg"
from a terminal. Linux will display all kinds of info about the device 
including the sd? number assigned.  The sd? number will change on Linux 
with an external floppy with usb attached because its "removable media" so
if the device is plugged in before boot it will be assigned one number, but
if its plugged in after boot it may be assigned another number, and if you 
unplug after boot then replug you may get yet another sd? number assigned.
Just use "dmesg" to see what sd? number was assigned.
	



How do I get the image file onto a cdrom ?
*****************************************
If your computer is of a modern vintage, you may not have a 
floppy drive at all. Well you can instead make a boot cd.  My 
1998 vintage computer can boot from floppy or cd. My Dell 
desktop at work does not have a floppy drive. Booting from cd
is of course preferred because the drive read speed is several 
times faster than a floppy.

This instructions are for linux users who have the commandline
tools "mkisofs" and "cdrecord" installed.

See instructions above for how to make an image file.
Uncomment the following line in the file "build.s":

	times 1474560 - ($-$$) db 0

It is necessary to generate an image file for cdrom that is
exactly the full size of a floppy disc (1470560 bytes).


Once you have a 1474560 byte size image file, the next step is
to generate an "iso" file. Read up on "man mkisofs" and especially 
the -b option which allows for making the "El Torito" boot cd.

 	mkisofs -b myimagefile.img -R -o file.iso /home/tom/myimagefile.img
 
 
Now use the commandline tool "cdrecord" to burn the file.iso to disc:

	sudo cdrecord -v -tao speed=8  dev=/dev/hdd  file.iso


If you are using CD-RW discs first blank the disc:
	sudo cdrecord -v blank=fast speed=8  dev=/dev/hdd


If all this seems like too much work, the top level directory may
contain a script called "makebootcd" to automate the process.

Windows users may be able to use a program like "Nero" to make a 
bootable cd. I have not tested this.




How do I get the disc image on a usb pendrive ?
************************************************
My computers are too old and the bios does not support 
booting from a pen drive.

But the boot code in boot2.s is written to support booting 
from a usb mass storage device (pendrive/memory stick). As of Jan 2010
a volume boot record has been added to /boot/boot1.s to inform the bios
that tatOS should be booted like a floppy drive. This has been found to
work on most newer laptops and desktops I have been able to test.
The tatOS bootsector is really designed for booting from floppy as the 
first 512 bytes do not have a partition table and do not have an MBR 
master boot record. If your bios reads your flash and expects to find a
partition table like a hard drive, it may not boot tatOS.
	
On linux you can use the program "dd" to copy to/from the pen drive.
To put your image file on a pen drive use:

	dd if=tatos.img of=/dev/sda

Again remember that this operation will destroy the filesystem and
so you will not be able to view contents thru a file manager. Its 
best to have a spare pen drive for your image files. My pendrive stores
the tatos.img starting at LBA=0 and I keep my tatOS applications on the 
same pendrive starting at LBA=10,000 and beyond.





So how do you boot a disc image ?
************************************
Booting a computer from removable media takes a bit of patience.  
Each bios has its own quirks and keystrokes.

First you must insert the disc into the drive when the computer 
off. With a floppy disc or flash drive this is easy. With a cdrom 
disc you cant normally push the button to get the door open without 
power. In this case just take a paper clip and bend it straight and 
insert it into the little hole in the front of you cd drive and push 
gently until the door pops open. If you happen to be running your 
favorite operating system (Linux) and want to run the cd image 
just insert the bootcd, and reboot your computer.

My older computers boot automatically from floppy which is nice.

It seems the newer computers require some kind of intervention.
The bios must scan all the removable media ports and devices to populate
a potential boot list then you must pick your item, sometimes moving it
to the top of the list.

My Gateway tower at home, on startup will first check for a floppy to 
boot then it checks for a cd to boot then lastly if no floppy or cd is 
found it will boot from the hard drive.

My Dell tower at work is differant. First there is no floppy and 
it will automatically boot from hard drive unless you press F12 
shortly after power up. This will suspend the normal boot process 
and give you a menu to select boot from cd or boot from hard drive 
or boot from usb mass storage device.

My daughters 2009 HP Pavillion laptop requires you press the "ESC" key
shortly after powerup and this will give you a menu where you select F9 
for boot options and then it gives you a list of selected media to boot from.

Two other slightly older HP Pavillions I tried require you to poll the f10 key
on startup in order to enter the bios config menu. Then immediately
exit the bios without saving changes. Then the external floppy drive
is read and tatOS boots as desired.

Some computers may only boot well from the first boot drive listed in the bios. 
So you may have to go into the bios and if you want to boot from flash make 
this the first boot drive. The bios may not save this so you will have to go back 
into bios every time you boot.

Dell Inspiron 1000 actually adds my flash drive to the boot list under "hard drives".
You must get into the bios, find the hard drive boot list, and move your flash
drive entry to the top of the list.  Poll F12 to get into the bios on this one.





How do you access the bios setting ?
***************************************
You bios setting may need modification for booting a disc.
This includes changing the boot order for removable media.

How to access the bios settings will depend on your computer. 
Read your boot messages or just use trial and error.

On my Gateway at home, poll the F1 key shortly after startup. 

On a Dell at work you poll the F2 key. 

HP Pavillions require either the ESC key to interrupt boot or f10 to enter bios.

Another computer I tested used the F2 key.

Custom build with Asus motherboard requires DEL key on boot.

Poll means to press and release the key about once every second. 
Your bios will detect the key presses and suspend the boot 
process and give you access to the bios menu settings.







So how do I shutdown ?
***********************
My image files have no software to control Advanced Power 
Management. There are no file buffers to flush as read10
and write10 work immediately without buffers.
All the software is loaded from floppy/cd immediately 
on startup so you can remove the disc any time and just push your 
computer power button to shutdown.





To run your img file with an emulator
********************************************
Bochs and Qemu are swiss army knife programs that can run just 
about any operating system or bootable image file because they 
emulate the cpu instructions directly.  

Bochs:
On Debian need to install packages: bochs, bochs_doc, bochsbios, bochs_sdl
First edit your bochsrc which is your startup/config file. 
If you dont have bochsrc run bochs then pick option [4] "Save Options to.."
Locate bochsrc in the same directory where your tatOS.img file is located. 
Edit the bochsrc file as follows:
	display_library: sdl
	megs: 60
	floppya: 1_44=/home/tom/projects/tatOS/tatOS.img, status=inserted
	log:bochs.out
	debug: action=report  (or action=ignore)
	mouse:enabled=0, type=ps2

Using debug action=report will generate a bochs.out file of several hundred megabyte
so normally you should use action=ignore
To run tatOS.img inside bochs, just cd to the tatOS.img directory and type "bochs" 


Toggle the Scroll Lock key for a full screen window. 
Alt-F4 to close a window. 
Your img file mouse driver will be active immediately. 
To toggle the mouse driver between bochs and Xwindow mouse use Ctrl+Alt+MiddleMouseButton



Qemu:
You will see slight improvements in speed over bochs without
the accelerator package. Also fullscreen mode works. Download and 
unpack the Linux package in your root directory. To run a bootable 
floppy image from the commandline: 
	"qemu  -no-kqemu -boot a -fda tictactoe.img"
	-full-screen (Ctrl+Alt+f exit to window mode)
	-snapshot    (write to tmp files instead)

Clicking in the window will activate your img file mouse driver.
Ctrl+Alt will return the mouse to the qemu Xwindow for closing.







Development tools
*****************
If you want to develop your own image files.

* Linux host OS
* NASM assembler
* make: to execute the makefile 
* bochs or qemu emulator to test img b4 real hdwre
* dd or cp: to copy the image to floppy disc or pen drive
* mkisofs & cdrecord: to make a bootable cd
* a couple old computers laying around for testing
* a cd burner
* a usb mass storage device aka pen drive memory stick
* an external floppy drive with usb attach



Enjoy your image file.

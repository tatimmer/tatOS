The usb keyboard gives a multi byte report.
The values given are all differant then ps2 keyboard scancodes

Here is a table giving the keyboard report for various key combinations

The keyboard used is identified as: 
"Gear Head"
107 Key Gear Head Keyboard
Model No. KB2500U
made in china

I got this data by going thru the usb mouse init sequence with the usb keyboard
Yes the tatOS usb mouse init sequence works just fine on the usb keyboard
since they are both low speed usb 1.0 devices

The keyboard report is max 8 bytes: "aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh"

with all keys up all the bytes are 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

when a single key is pressed, most keys give a value in the 'cc' byte
all the other bytes remain 00
the CTRL, ALT, SHIFT keys give a value in the 'aa' byte, see below

when you hold down 2 keys like 'a' then 'b' the 
first key pressed is the 'cc' byte, the 2nd key pressed is the 'dd' byte
if you press 3 keys at once the third key pressed is the 'ee' byte
the tatOS usb keyboard driver does not support holding down 3 keys other than
CTRL+ALT+DEL and you can only hold down 2 keys like CTRL+ or SHIFT+

I have not found the 'bb' byte to give anything other than 00

there are some multiple key combinations like 'rty' held down together that
must cause an overflow and the keyboard report just shows 00 00 01 01 01 01 01 

the table below gives the report for a single key pressed
along with which byte of the report is giving the value

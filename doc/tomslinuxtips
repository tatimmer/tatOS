dd
raw byte copy and file converter
can copy any amount of bytes from anywhere to anywhere
do not mount before or after
raw dd copy to floppy wipes out floppy file system
bs sets input and output block size to n bytes

to check the size of all files on a floppy first mount
the floppy then cd to /media/floppy then issue "du -k"
which will give you the number of kilobytes on the floppy

fdformat 
do not mount floppy
to format a floppy is a 2 step process on Linux
[1] fdformat /dev/fd0
this will erase all data including the file system
[2] mkdosfs -v -F 32 /dev/fd0
this will create FAT32 filesystem on floppy
now you are ready to mount floppy and cp files
you will need these commands if you have a boot floppy
and want to instead store files on it with a file system.

/usr/bin/cpp -> /etc/alternatives/cpp -> /usr/bin/cpp-3.4.1
/usr/bin/g++ ->  /etc/alternatives/g++ -> /usr/bin/g++-3.4.1
note cpp is the c preprocessor not the c++ compiler
to link with static library libtom.a  you would use gcc -o  main  main.c -ltom
to link with shared library libtom.so you would use gcc -o  main  main.c -ltom
if both exist then gcc will always grab the shared library first,

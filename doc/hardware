A brief discussion on tatOS Supported Hardware.
Further down are discussions about failure as well.

       Success
;***********************


Desktop or Laptop PC circa Windows98-2008
Computer has (2) ubs ports on back for UHCI controller
or a single EHCI controller with up to 4 ports.

Ive tested the following:
	* Gateway P2 desktop circa 1998
	* Emachines P3 desktop circa 2000 & 2005
	* Dell P4 desktop 2006
	* Toshiba laptop circa 1998
	* CBS custom build P3 circa 1999
	* HP Pavillion Laptop circa 2009
	* Dell Latitute & Inspiron laptops
	* Asus Eee 1001PX 10" Netbook, Intel Atom circa 2012
	* Acer laptop circa 2013
	* Lenovo ThinkCenter Desktop M81 series


* processor: 
	A single 32bit (x86) w/MMX processor is preferred 
	This includes Pentium II 350mhz, Pentium III 550 mhz
	64bit and dual core work with mixed success 
	This includes Intel Core2 Duo, AMD Turion 64 x2
	tatOS uses 32 bit protect mode and will not use 64 bit registers or addressing
	if dual core, tatOS uses the Bootstrap processor only

	Here are some of the processors tatOS has been found to run on.
	Run cpuid from the shell to get this information.

* Macintosh & VmWare
My sons mac laptop with vmware 
this laptop actually has a usb 3.0 xHCI controller but
the tatOS pci scan for usb controllers reports OHCI and EHCI controller (emulated)
EHCI controller bus/dev/fun = 00/0b/00
so you can reassemble tatOS with USBCONTROLLERTYPE=3 and the above bus/dev/fun
and use EHCI only with no usb 1.0 support since tatOS does not support OHCI



* USB mouse:
	tatOS supports usb mouse as std
	Logitech, Microsoft or Manhattan all work
	I suggest to stick with the corded mouse
	one Logitch wireless mouse hangs at GET_PROTOCOL
	left button, right button, wheel also acts as 3rd button
	a uhci controlled port is required
	ehci must have uhci companion controller to hand off or rate matching hub
	the Manhattan mouse has an 01 byte in the report-see tatos.config


* ps2 mouse: 
	ps2 mouse is depreciated in favor of usb
	ps/2 (6 pin round connector)
	3 button with wheel (pushing wheel is 3rd button)
	2 button without wheel is unsupported
	A USB mouse with usb2ps2 adapter may or may not work.
	Logitech mouse=yes, microsoft mouse=no


* ps2 Keyboard: 
	ps2 keyboard is still supported but only as backup
	ps/2 (6-pin round connector)
	the driver supports std US Windows style with 104 keys
	numeric pad, arrow keys, ins/del/hom/end/Pgup/Pgdn group
	defaults to scancode set number=1 (XT)
	scancode sets 2,3 unsupported
	usb connector on end of chord unsupported
	ps2init code works on HP laptops and on my Asus netbook


* usb keyboard:
    we now have driver code for usb keyboard that works (most of the time)
	will get an occasional "freeze"
	keyboard interrupt is polled by irq0 PIT 


* video adapter: 
	SVGA, 800x600x8bpp, 256 color graphics
	this is the only graphics mode supported


* BIOS that is VESA VBE 2.0 or later


* Floppy Drive:
	3.5 inch diskette, 
	1.44MB, 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per cylinder
	80 cylinders/tracks, 2 heads
	tatOS boots best from floppy 
	if you dont have an internal floppy drive 
	then go buy a cheep external floppy drive that plugs into a usb port
	tatOS will also boot from usb pendrive if your bios supports floppy emulation


* USB Controllers: 

	Flash drive works on computers with a single ehci or uhci.
	Mouse works on uhci only.
	OHCI (IEEE 1394) is unsupported
	xHCI is unsupported
	Multiple EHCI controllers are unsupported
	Intel or Via ehci are recommended 
	I would avoid nVidea ehci because I cant find controller documentation
	and because they use ohci companion controllers which are unsupported

	The following usb controllers have been found to work on tatOS:

	** Intel N10/ICH7 EHCI, DID=0x27cc, VID=0x8086
	this is found on the Asus 1001PX netbook

	** Intel 82371   UHCI, DID=0x7112, VID=0x8086
	this is the common one found on older desktops

	** Intel 82801   EHCI, DID=0x2937  VID=0x8086  ICH9 
	found on my daughters HP Pavillion, has uhci companion controllers
	ehci uses 64bit addressing

	** Intel  82801DB/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-M) EHCI, DID=0x24cd, VID=0x8086
	found on Dell Latitude D600

	** Via VT6212    EHCI, DID=0x3104, VID=0x1106
	This is a pci add-on card mfg by Manhattan-works great
	has 1 ehci to control 4 ports with 2 uhci companion controllers

	** nVidia MCP51, EHCI, DID=0x026e, VID=0x10de
	found on e-Machines and HP Pavillion a154On Desktop
	use one of four ehci ports on the back not ohci port on front, no uhci 
	
	** nVidia MCP67 EHCI, DID=0x055f  VID=0x10de
	found on HP Pavilion dv6000 laptop
	f9 key to change boot device

	** nVidia CK804 EHCI, DID=0x005b, VID=0x10de
	found on a 64bit dual core custom build AMD machine with Asus motherboard
	four ehci ports on the back and two ohci ports on front

	** Silicon Integrated Systems EHCI, DID=0x7002, VID=0x1039
	found on Dell Inspiron 1000



* USB Mass Storage Device Flash-Drive, Memory-Stick, Pen-Drive

	Most any pen drive/memory stick/flash drive (USB 2.0 ok)
	FAT16 filesystem is supported
	Windows will complain because the drive is not partitioned
	Here is a list of devices I have tested and all work:

[1]
SimpleTech  "BonzaiXpress"  256MB
appearance=light blue aluminum with cap and external led
P/N 90000-60002-012U
VID=0x0ea0
PID=0x2168
EPIN = 01
EPOUT= 02
maxLBA=0x7b7ff
blink: slow idle, fast read/write
SCSI Inquiry: "Simple Flash Disk 2.0  2.00"
comment:My first device, easy to enumerate, works well
        FAT16 filesystem

[1] Dec09
HP Pavillion laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T6500 @ 2.10ghz.
this is a 64 bit dual core with (2) ehci's that uses 64bit addressing
ehci-1 did:vid = 0x293a8086, Intel 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller
ehci-2 did:vid = 0x293c8086, Intel 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller
this device supports up to (12) PORTSC registers
tatOS only supports a single ehci and up to 4 PORTSC registers
on this computer all PORTSC returns 0x1000=no devices connected and port disabled


[2] tried to boot my sons Mac laptop but it has EFI, no bios

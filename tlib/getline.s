;you can now put asm comments on the same line as the code

;************************************************
;getline
;reads an ascii text file 
;lines are terminated by NEWLINE/NL/0xa
;the file must be terminated with 0
;this function is customized for the ttasm assembler 

;copies bytes to a seperate buffer and 0 terminates by the following rules:
;  * if NL terminator is found stop reading and exit 
;  * if : colon is read, stop saving bytes but read to end of line 
;    this would indicate a code label
;    colon not allowed within ascii string bounded by ''
;    SPACE not allowed on code label line 
;  * if ; semicolon is read stop saving bytes but read to end of line
;  * if 80 chars have been read and not 0 terminator, quit with error
;  * if leading SPACE or TAB, ignore

;input
;esi=address of ascii source
;edi=address of buffer to copy bytes to

;return
;esi is incremented to the last byte fetched
;eax=return code:
;	0=successful copy, found NEWLINE, 0 terminated
;   1=blank line found
;	2=error:parse error or buffer full and not 0 terminated
;   3=found 0 (eof)
;   5=code_label: (ends with :)

;we no longer return 4 comment line, its folded in with blank line
;this function will now silently eat up comment lines by itself
;or comments after a line of asm code

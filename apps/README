tatOS/apps/README

Most tatOS apps last re-assembled with ttasm on May 2015

This directory contains assembly language code and tips from my own flash drive.
You can copy these files to a tatOS formatted flash drive and then boot tatOS 
and read this source code into tedit text editor and within tedit you can 
assemble these apps using ttasm and then run these programs directly from 
the editor. 

Some of these apps like 3dwire, minesweeper & tcad I developed from scratch on 
tatOS.  Others are authored as noted (mandelbrot, butterfly) and tweeked by 
me so they run under tlib and tatOS with 800x600, 256 color graphics. 

Thanks for trying tatOS.
